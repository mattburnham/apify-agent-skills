# Apify Actor Development

**Important:** Before you begin, fill in the `generatedBy` property in the meta section of `.actor/actor.json`. Replace it with the tool and model you're currently using, such as "Claude Code with Claude Sonnet 4.5". This helps Apify monitor and improve AGENTS.md for specific AI tools and models.

## What are Apify Actors?

Actors are serverless programs inspired by the UNIX philosophy - programs that do one thing well and can be easily combined to build complex systems. They're packaged as Docker images and run in isolated containers in the cloud.

**Core Concepts:**
- Accept well-defined JSON input
- Perform isolated tasks (web scraping, automation, data processing)
- Produce structured JSON output to datasets and/or store data in key-value stores
- Can run from seconds to hours or even indefinitely
- Persist state and can be restarted

## Prerequisites & Setup (MANDATORY)

Before creating or modifying actors, verify that `apify` CLI is installed `apify --help`.

If it is not installed, you can run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://apify.com/install-cli.sh | bash

# Or (Mac): brew install apify-cli
# Or (Windows): irm https://apify.com/install-cli.ps1 | iex
# Or: npm install -g apify-cli
```

When the apify CLI is installed, check that it is logged in with:

```bash
apify info  # Should return your username
```

If it is not logged in, check if the APIFY_TOKEN environment variable is defined (if not, ask the user to generate one on https://console.apify.com/settings/integrations and then define APIFY_TOKEN with it).

Then run:

```bash
apify login -t $APIFY_TOKEN
```

## Template Selection

**IMPORTANT:** Before starting actor development, always ask the user which programming language they prefer:
- **JavaScript** - Use `apify create <actor-name> -t project_empty`
- **TypeScript** - Use `apify create <actor-name> -t ts_empty`
- **Python** - Use `apify create <actor-name> -t python-empty`

Use the appropriate CLI command based on the user's language choice. Additional packages (Crawlee, Playwright, etc.) can be installed later as needed.

## Quick Start Workflow

1. **Create actor project** - Run the appropriate `apify create` command based on user's language preference (see Template Selection above)
2. **Install dependencies**
   - JavaScript/TypeScript: `npm install`
   - Python: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Implement logic** - Write the actor code in `src/main.py`, `src/main.js`, or `src/main.ts`
4. **Configure schemas** - Update input/output schemas in `.actor/input_schema.json`, `.actor/output_schema.json`, `.actor/dataset_schema.json`
5. **Configure platform settings** - Update `.actor/actor.json` with actor metadata (see [references/actor-json.md](references/actor-json.md))
6. **Write documentation** - Create comprehensive README.md for the marketplace
7. **Test locally** - Run `apify run` to verify functionality (see Local Testing section below)
8. **Deploy** - Run `apify push` to deploy the actor on the Apify platform (actor name is defined in `.actor/actor.json`)

## Best Practices

**✓ Do:**
- Use `apify run` to test actors locally (configures Apify environment and storage)
- Use Apify SDK (`apify`) for code running ON Apify platform
- Validate input early with proper error handling and fail gracefully
- Use CheerioCrawler for static HTML (10x faster than browsers)
- Use PlaywrightCrawler only for JavaScript-heavy sites
- Use router pattern (createCheerioRouter/createPlaywrightRouter) for complex crawls
- Implement retry strategies with exponential backoff
- Use proper concurrency: HTTP (10-50), Browser (1-5)
- Set sensible defaults in `.actor/input_schema.json`
- Define output schema in `.actor/output_schema.json`
- Clean and validate data before pushing to dataset
- Use semantic CSS selectors with fallback strategies
- Respect robots.txt, ToS, and implement rate limiting
- **Always use `apify/log` package** - censors sensitive data (API keys, tokens, credentials)
- Implement readiness probe handler (required if your Actor uses standby mode)

**✗ Don't:**
- Use `npm start`, `npm run start`, `npx apify run`, or similar commands to run actors (use `apify run` instead)
- Assume local storage from `apify run` is pushed to or visible in the Apify Console — it is local-only; deploy with `apify push` and run on the platform to see results in the Console
- Rely on `Dataset.getInfo()` for final counts on Cloud
- Use browser crawlers when HTTP/Cheerio works
- Hard code values that should be in input schema or environment variables
- Skip input validation or error handling
- Overload servers - use appropriate concurrency and delays
- Scrape prohibited content or ignore Terms of Service
- Store personal/sensitive data unless explicitly permitted
- Use deprecated options like `requestHandlerTimeoutMillis` on CheerioCrawler (v3.x)
- Use `additionalHttpHeaders` - use `preNavigationHooks` instead
- Disable standby mode without explicit permission

## Logging

See [references/logging.md](references/logging.md) for complete logging documentation including available log levels and best practices for JavaScript/TypeScript and Python.

Check `usesStandbyMode` in `.actor/actor.json` - only implement if set to `true`.

## Commands

```bash
apify run          # Run Actor locally
apify login        # Authenticate account
apify push         # Deploy to Apify platform (uses name from .actor/actor.json)
apify help         # List all commands
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always use `apify run` to test actors locally. Do not use `npm run start`, `npm start`, `yarn start`, or other package manager commands - these will not properly configure the Apify environment and storage.

## Local Testing

When testing an actor locally with `apify run`, provide input data by creating a JSON file at:

```
storage/key_value_stores/default/INPUT.json
```

This file should contain the input parameters defined in your `.actor/input_schema.json`. The actor will read this input when running locally, mirroring how it receives input on the Apify platform.

**IMPORTANT - Local storage is NOT synced to the Apify Console:**
- Running `apify run` stores all data (datasets, key-value stores, request queues) **only on your local filesystem** in the `storage/` directory.
- This data is **never** automatically uploaded or pushed to the Apify platform. It exists only on your machine.
- To verify results on the Apify Console, you must deploy the Actor with `apify push` and then run it on the platform.
- Do **not** rely on checking the Apify Console to verify results from local runs — instead, inspect the local `storage/` directory or check the Actor's log output.

## Standby Mode

See [references/standby-mode.md](references/standby-mode.md) for complete standby mode documentation including readiness probe implementation for JavaScript/TypeScript and Python.
