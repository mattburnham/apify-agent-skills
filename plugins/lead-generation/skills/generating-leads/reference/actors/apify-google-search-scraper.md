## Cost Management Guidelines for AI

### Default Behavior
- Always start with base tier (no add-ons)
- Never enable premium features without user confirmation
- Warn about extreme costs for AI Mode and Perplexity

### When to Ask About Paid Features

**Moderate-cost add-on (+$6.50 per 1,000 results):**
- User says "ads", "paid results" → Offer includePaidResults

**Prompt format:**
> "I can enable paid results extraction which adds ~$6.50 per 1,000 results ($Y for Z results). Continue? (y/n)"

**High-cost add-on (+$100 per 1,000 results):**
- User says "decision makers", "employee contacts" → Warn about business leads enrichment

**Prompt format:**
> "🚨 **Warning:** Business leads enrichment costs $100 per 1,000 results (~$10 for 100 results, $2 for 20 results).
>
> This provides decision-maker contacts and should only be used for high-value B2B outreach.
>
> I recommend starting with 20-50 results to control costs.
>
> Continue? (y/n)"

**Very high-cost add-ons (+$200 per 1,000 results):**
- User says "AI overview", "GEO tracking" → Warn about Google AI Mode
- User says "Perplexity", "cross-platform research" → Warn about Perplexity AI

**Prompt format:**
> "🚨 **Warning:** [Feature name] is a premium feature that costs $200 per 1,000 results (~$20 for 100 results, $2 for 10 results).
>
> [Explain what data it provides and use cases]
>
> This is VERY expensive. I strongly recommend testing with only 10-20 results first.
>
> Continue? (y/n)"

### Cost Estimation

Always show cost estimate before running:
- Calculate: (results / 1000) × (base cost + add-on costs)
- For multiple queries: multiply by number of queries
- Show estimate: "Estimated cost: $X.XX"

### Cost Control Strategies

For expensive add-ons, always recommend:
1. **Start small:** Test with 10-20 results first
2. **Reduce resultsPerPage:** Lower from 100 to 10-20 for premium features
3. **Limit queries:** Use 1-2 queries initially, not 10+
4. **Explain cost math:** "Each query × results = total cost"

### Alternative Suggestions

If user declines premium features:
- "Decision makers" → "I can find company websites with base search, then use Contact Details Scraper separately (cheaper)"
- "AI overview" → "I can provide regular search results which you can analyze yourself"
- "Perplexity" → "I can search Google normally, then you can research topics manually"
